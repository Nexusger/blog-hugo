This blog post is one part of the series "learning diary" for a course at my university.


# Goals:


Based on the title for that unit I assume we will learn something about storytelling in the context of didactic.


# What have I learned:


People remember stories. If information is wrapped up in a story, it increases the possibility that one remember the information as well.

A story consists of a setting, a plot, a character, a narrator with a point of view, (words, pictures, sounds) and most importantly listeners or readers.

Scheherazade from 1001 Nights is one of the earliest cliffhanger provider.

**Wandering storytellers**



* Minstrels, Jester (like street musicians)
* Troubadour (for the higher in the hierarchy)
* Minnesinger (in Germany, especially Walther von der Vogelweide)

**Chansonnier**



* Secular song books. They not only told stories and song but wrote them down.

**Icelandic Kvöldvaka**

Because of the long winter all family members would gather in one room and one person would be chosen to read a storybook for all members. Usually a child or a guest did the reading.

**There is more:**

Songs, Music, Poems, Theater, Dance, Political satire

**Narrative:**



* Story or part of story
* Narrator and points of view
* Time flow
* fictional or true story
* structure

	* Story / plot / figures
	* Most imortant: reception: What happens in the listener
	* Representation



**Digital story telling**



* Point of view
* a dramatic question
* emotional content
* the gift of your voice
* the power of the soundtrack
* economy
* pacing

Green Eggs and Ham from Dr.Seuss only has 50 words!

**Non linear structure**



* Nodes and branches
* attributes for the branches
* circles
* multiple stories
