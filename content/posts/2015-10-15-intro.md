As part of the course "[Didaktics of Media](http://people.f4.htw-berlin.de/~weberwu/didaktics/)" at the University of Applied Sciences Berlin all participants are oblieged to write a learning diary. The learning diary shall enable the students to discover how we learn best.

As part of the learning diary we also have to write two articles about our learning environment. That is, all tools and behaviours we use to learn. The first article should contain the current situation of our learning environment, the second the situation at the end the course. Hopefully after comparing both articles the students are able to see what worked best for them.

All my posts for this course will reside under the category "[Learning Diary](/categories/learning-diary/)"
