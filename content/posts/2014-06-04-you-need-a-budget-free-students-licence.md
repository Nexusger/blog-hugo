I'm a huge fan of the software [You Need A Budget](https://www.youneedabudget.com/) for my budgeting purposes. I was evaluating the software after I realized that my Excel solution is not feasible (read: to complicated).

I installed the 30 days trial version until it expired. After that I uninstalled it and used the Steam demo version. So I had double the evaluation time. And evaluate I did. After that time I was this close to actually purchase YNAB 4 via Steam. But as a student I'm rather short on money. (That's why I need to budget in the first place...)

But hey, I've got more luck than judgement and [on the end of march YNAB 4 was released for free for students](http://www.youneedabudget.com/blog/2014/ynab-is-now-free-for-college-students/)! Lucky me.


#### Conditions

* You have to be a student of a college (in Germany: Fachhochschule ist auch in Ordnung)
* This is NOT limited to US students
* The licence is valid for the current year. After that date you have to ask for a new licence, if you are still a student.

If you are a student and struggle with your money (who doesn't?) I realy recommend you to try YNAB in the trial version. And if you like it, grab YNAB 4 for free.


###### Disclaimer:
I don't work for YNAB and I'm not related to the company. My only benefit was the free student version.
