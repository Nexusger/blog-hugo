A new term started today and so far nothing interesting happened. System management and analysis would be generally an interesting course, but till now it's only a recapitulation of known facts, so everyone has the same level of knowledge.

The problem is: There are so many students here which seem to know everything, or at least think that they know everything. (Of course, only [David](http://hadizadeh.de/) knows everything). It's interesting when they answer a mere rethorical question wrong and the lecturer tries to avoid to say: "That's wrong". Instead he comments the answers with a variety of versions like "Um, yes, in a certain way you could say that" or "Interesting idea, but not exactly what I was looking for". And I think some of the students think they made an important statement.

But it's the first day, I probably won't see most of the other students again until the exam is on due.
