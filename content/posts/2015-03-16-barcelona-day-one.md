Today my fiancée and I flew to Barcelona, for our vacation.  It's a bit early in the year for a hot Spain holiday, but the city is big enough to cover some bad-weather days.

We flew with germanwings from Berlin at 11 AM and had a pleasantly easy flight. My fiancée and I played Ticket to Ride on her iPad (two times, we had a tie). By the way, Ticket to Ride is a nice game you should absolutly try it once [(Amazon Affiliate Link)](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0002LN71Q/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=19454&creativeASIN=B0002LN71Q&linkCode=as2&tag=krams0c-21&linkId=4HNGPMVPAMAY5AEX)![](http://ir-de.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=krams0c-21&l=as2&o=3&a=B0002LN71Q)


In Barcelona we took the Aerobus Barcelona to the plaça del catalunya and walked the last part to our AirBnB accommodation. Next to our apartment is a small café, in which we had  café con leché and a bocadillo, while we waited for out host.

The apartment is small but nice. From our balcony we can see the [Sagrada Familia](http://www.sagradafamilia.cat/) [![Picture from our balcony, Sagrada Familia in the distance](/images/2015-03-16-barcelona-day-one/wpid-img_20150316_190705-300x300.jpg)

 and we have a Mercato on the opposite of the street. After we ran some errands we prepared a nice tortilla with guacamole. Yummy!
Because of the holidays, I gifted my self with a set of different brands of beer:

So far I tested three of them and they were all very nice.
