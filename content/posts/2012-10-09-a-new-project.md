Whoohaaa a new project from the university. David and I were assigned to the Computer Museum on the university campus. There we (and six other students) will be responsible to install, customize and deploy a tool called CollectiveAccess ([Homepage](http://www.collectiveaccess.org/)). CA is a open source tool to register items, tag and mark them and then display them on a front end.

There were two teams of the terms before us, who already made some analysis,Â set up server and even made some sleek videos of some of the items. We'll have to analyze which of their data is useful for us and which data can be abandoned.

In this project, we will work closely with the museology team of our university, so it's a interdisciplinary project. We'll have to see if we can help them with our skills
