[ZLocation](https://github.com/vors/ZLocation) ("A `cd` that learns") is a PowerShell module for better navigating through folders.

I used the [predecessor](https://github.com/tkellogg/Jump-Location)Â for a while and was fed up with corrupted database entries. I'll test ZLocation thorough-fully but try it for your self!
