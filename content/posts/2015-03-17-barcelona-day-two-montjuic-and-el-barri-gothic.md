The second day of our holiday started relaxed: We slept till 11 AM and had a long breakfast with cereals and toast. Interestingly enough the milk you can buy here in the supermarket gets sold uncooled. This seemed a littel bit odd to me, because in Germany almost all milk is getting sold cooled. The only milk in Germany you can buy uncooled is UHT-milk. So I assume the milk is kinda prepared as well. Also interesting: We bought everything for German breakfast (bread, butter, cheese and wurst) but the wurst happened to be cooked ham (called "Mini York"). That alone wouldn't be bad at all but the ham tasted literally like nothing...

Anyway, we started our sunny day [![IMG_20150317_135609](/images/2015-03-17-barcelona-day-two-montjuic-and-el-barri-gothic/IMG_20150317_135609-300x225.jpg)
](/images/2015-03-17-barcelona-day-two-montjuic-and-el-barri-gothic/IMG_20150317_135609.jpg) with a metro ride (9,95â‚¬ for 10 rides, very cheap in comparison to Berlin) to the Placa de Espana where we walked our way up to the Museo nacional d' Art de Catalunya [![IMG_20150317_155635](/images/2015-03-17-barcelona-day-two-montjuic-and-el-barri-gothic/IMG_20150317_155635-300x225.jpg)

We planned to use the cable car to district El Raval, which was marked in our map, but this cable car just didn't exist. So we took the bus to the station universitat where we strolled through the districts. We saw some nice small alleys (and found some guardian gooses [![IMG_20150317_183347](/images/2015-03-17-barcelona-day-two-montjuic-and-el-barri-gothic/IMG_20150317_183347-300x225.jpg)
](/images/2015-03-17-barcelona-day-two-montjuic-and-el-barri-gothic/IMG_20150317_183347.jpg)) and ate some "original" catalan food. I bet they took more money from us than it was worth, but that's the way of the tourist :-)

**I do know that the images are all messed up. I have to look into that when I'm back**
