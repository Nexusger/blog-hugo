I was looking for a javascript gallery plugin for a website I maintain. After I checked two or three plugins (incl. [galleria](http://galleria.aino.se/)) I decided that [Slideshow2](http://www.electricprism.com/aeron/slideshow/) is the tool, I'll use. One of the big points in my decision for Slideshow2 was the simple integration of a vertical thumbnail list. I tried it in galleria as well but failed.

With Slideshow2 everything went well. Download the package, edit the file like specified and voil√° you've got an vertical thumbnail list. Life can be so easy...

... until you add additional pictures: With more thumbnails than the complete height of the container (around eight in my case) the problems reveal. There is no scrolling!

After some (read alot) try and error I wrote to the googlegroup of the developer and sent a complete error description and a way to reproduce the problem in. So stay tuned :-)
