My fellow student [Alexander Czyrny](https://czyrny.net/2016/01/15/latex-vorlage-fuer-bachelor-master-und-wissenschaftliche-arbeiten/) made a template for his master thesis in LaTeX. The template covers all basic layout settings needed for a master thesis at our University ([University of Applied Sciences Berlin](http://htw.berlin)). He also added an example chapter with the more advanced LaTeX commands.

If you wan't to check it out clone his repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/a-czyrny/LaTeX-Master-Vorlage) !
