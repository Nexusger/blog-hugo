Two days ago I've updated Ubuntu to 11.10 and it worked well.

I started from scratch, so I won't have to deal with "old" problems:

Here is my setup:

* Plain vanilla Lenovo Z370
* Harddrive was replaced by a 60 Gb Sata2 SSD
* Ubuntu 11.10 (Desktop edition)
* I installed the IdeaPad Driver Package ([get it here](https://launchpad.net/~lexical/+archive/ideapad)) to get rid of a lot of the "Keycode 240"

On the pro side:

* The sd-card reader works out of the f**king box!
* The key manager works!
* Fn + F1 = Suspend to ram!
* Fn + F2 = Switch the Backlite off
* Fn + F5 = Switch all wireless connections off
* Fn + F8 = Activates Num "block"
* Fn +F9-F12 = Media keys (Play, Stop, Next, Previous) tested in Banshee
* Fn + Arrow left + Arrow right = Louder and quiter

On the down side:

* Special keys 1-3 kill the deskop
* Special keys 4-5 didn't work
* Frequently sended "keycode 240" interupts the standby
* Fn functions:
* Fn + Esc = Nothing happens (should disable the camera)
* Fn + F4 = No function (should do ...)
* Fn + F6 = No function (should disable the touchpad)
* Fn + Arrow Up, Arrow Down (is a little bit buggy) (Should adjust the intensity of the backlite)

Untested:

* HDMI connection with my 23" Monitor
* Fn + F3 = Switch between display modes (for beamer and external displays)

Unconfirmed:

* The new Ubuntu feels like it uses more energy (which I can't prove right now)
