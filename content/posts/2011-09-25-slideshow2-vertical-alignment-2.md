To update my last [post](/2011/08/slideshow2-vertical-alignment/), this solution worked for me:

On the Slideshow2 [homepage](http://www.electricprism.com/aeron/slideshow/) is an working example with vertical alignment. So I downloaded exactlyÂ  this version of the slideshow2.js and the according mootools and tadaa! It works. It seems that the current version simply is not capable of vertical scrolling.

A single drawback is still there: The option "resize" doesn't work. But as long as you can live with that, the slideshow2 V1.2.5.1 is sufficient
