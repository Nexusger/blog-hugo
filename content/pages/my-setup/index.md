This Section is updated more or less constantly


## Main Machine


I work mostly on my Lenovo Thinkpad T520 with an i7-2670QM processor and 12 Gig of RAM. Because I use my machine a lot on my desk I'm using a Lenovo Minidock 3 Plus Dockingstation and two external displays.


## Mobile


Currently I'm using a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact. I retired my Samsung Galaxy because of various problems with the hardware. The Sony, although it costed half the money, feels way snappier and the battery last ages (okay, a day)


## Storage


I'm happy to own a HP Microserver with 8 TB Harddisk, which I'm using for storage purposes. All external drives are attached to that thingy and are available in the network


## Home Theatre PC


Yeah, then there is this little old monster [IÂ call HTPC](http://blog.nexusger.de/2014/02/home-theatre-pc/)...
